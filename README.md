# UFOs

### Overview
The purpose of the UFO Data webpage is to give the user access and freedom to parse the given data, while allowing filters to be called upon for many of the related criteria. The dynamics of this webpage will grant users better control of the data they view, and more importantly allow users to only view data that meets the criteria they desire.

### Results
This dynamic webpage will function as follows:

For demonstration purposes of the dynamic features the scenario will be as follows:
Ted remembers on night he was hanging out with his friends in Grants Pass Oregon, the date was 1/1/2010, he remembers the date because it seemed like an odd way to bring in the new year. Ted recalls seeing a triangle shaped craft with three red lights hovering over the mountians in the region. He wants to see if there is any documentation of this incident, so he turns to our UFO Sightings page.

###### With no filters applied:
  - All the UFO sighting data will be shown.All

###### Ted enters the date:
  - Will only show events that occoured on 1/1/2010, but the location is still vague and the data is vast.

###### Interested, Ted wants to see if there are any other events that reported triangle shaped UFOs
  - Ted Deletes previous filter criteria and filters the shape by triangle. Ted finds that there have been reports of triangle shaped UFOs reported all over the United States.

### Summary
This Dynamic webpage gives users access to data in a parsable and digestable way. It is clean and filterable making it even easier to dig through for any and all UFO enthuiast to look up events important to them, 
One drawback is that there is one important data point that is not filterable as of now, which is the duration of time the event lasted, i think that data will be called upon and we should update our HTML and JavaScript to make the duration column filterable as well.
For future development of this project wee could find articles pertaining to recent UFO sightings and publish them on the page.
we should also build a location for users to upload data or images of events they have encountered so we can begin to build our own data from here on out. The interaction on the page would also build community that keeps users coming back to the page for updates.
